## Abstract and Introduction
The chapter from the book "Ethics of Digital Well-Being: A Multidisciplinary Approach" discusses the incomplete mediation of emotions in online social media due to a heavy reliance on text-based communication. This reliance fosters a rationalistic bias and limits the expression of nuanced emotions, contributing to stalemates and informational bubbles in online interactions. The authors argue for a redesign of online deliberation platforms to incorporate a fuller range of human emotions, enhancing the role of emotions in moral interaction and deliberation[1].

## The Role of Emotions in Online Deliberation
The text emphasizes the importance of emotions in public debates, particularly in the context of controversial topics like technological risks. Emotions highlight what matters to people and contribute to moral reflection and public deliberation. However, online platforms often mediate emotions in a way that only allows for a narrow range of extreme expressions. This is due to the text-centered design of these platforms, which inherently downplays embodied interactions and nuanced emotional expressions. The authors suggest that this design flaw leads to hostile online interactions and a lack of effective communication, ultimately harming users' well-being[1].

## The Impact of Rationalistic Bias in Social Media
The chapter critiques the rationalistic bias inherent in social media platforms, which prioritizes text over non-verbal communication. This bias not only filters out social emotions but also facilitates the expression of antisocial emotions such as hostility. The authors argue that this design approach contributes to the prevalence of extreme emotions like outrage, which, while visible and studied, often do not lead to constructive outcomes. Instead, they can discourage participation from marginalized groups and reduce the effectiveness of collective action[1].

## Proposed Changes to Online Deliberation Platforms
To address these issues, the authors propose a shift in the design of online deliberation platforms. They suggest moving away from text-centered designs to those that allow for a complete expression of a full range of human emotions. This could potentially transform online interactions by making them more constructive and reflective of shared human experiences. The chapter calls for a rethinking of how emotions are integrated into online platforms to better support public engagement and well-being[1].

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the chapter argues that the current design of social media and online deliberation platforms does not adequately accommodate the full spectrum of human emotions, leading to poor quality deliberations and negative social outcomes. By redesigning these platforms to better express and manage emotions, there is potential for more meaningful and constructive online interactions that contribute to individual and collective well-being[1].

## Overview of Text-Based Communication and Its Limitations

The text discusses the inherent limitations of text-based online communication, particularly on social media platforms. It highlights how these platforms, designed primarily for text, fail to adequately convey the full spectrum of human emotions. This limitation stems from the historical use of text for conveying complex ideas rather than emotions, a practice that dates back to the 12th century with the invention of optical texts. These were designed for quick intellectual appraisal rather than emotional expression. The text argues that while text can convey complex ideas effectively, it is less capable of expressing subtle emotional nuances, leading to misinterpretations and a lack of emotional depth in online interactions.

## Problems with Text-Based Emotional Communication

### Lack of Meta-Communicational Features

The text identifies several key issues with text-based communication. First, it lacks meta-communicational features such as tone of voice, gestures, and facial expressions, which are crucial for understanding the emotional context of a message. For instance, the phrase "poor you!" can convey sympathy or sarcasm depending on the speaker's tone, a nuance often lost in text.

### Ambiguity and Misinterpretation

Emoticons and detailed textual descriptions are suggested as partial solutions, but they often fail to capture the full emotional spectrum, especially in brief messages typical of social media. Moreover, the ambiguity of text-based messages can lead to misinterpretations, further complicating online communication.

### Emotional Dishonesty and Underreporting

Another significant issue is the honesty of emotional expression online. The anonymity of the internet can encourage dishonesty or exaggeration of emotions like outrage, often for virtue signaling. Additionally, mild emotions are frequently underreported as they require effort to articulate, unlike extreme emotions which are more easily expressed through text modifiers like caps lock or exclamation marks.

## Design Proposals for Emotionally Rich Online Environments

### Enhancing Emotional Expression through Multimedia

The text proposes several design changes to foster richer emotional expression online. It suggests integrating video and audio clips into online deliberations to add a human element to text-based interactions. This approach could help convey the emotional states of speakers more effectively, making online communication more comparable to face-to-face interactions.

### Interactive and Responsive Design Features

Further suggestions include interactive features that prompt users to reconsider the emotional impact of their messages. For example, social media platforms could use AI algorithms to detect potentially harmful messages and encourage users to rethink their wording, enhancing emotional awareness and empathy among users.

### Combining Multiple Media Forms

The final proposal advocates for a convergence of multiple media forms—combining text with video, audio, emoticons, and images—to better capture and convey the full range of human emotions. This approach acknowledges the limitations of each medium alone and suggests a more holistic approach to online communication.

## Conclusion: Reevaluating Online Communication Design

The text concludes by emphasizing the need for online platforms to move beyond a purely text-based, rationalistic design. It argues that such a design overlooks the emotional aspects of communication, which are essential for meaningful interactions. By incorporating a broader range of communicative tools and designing for emotional richness, online platforms can better support constructive and empathetic deliberations.

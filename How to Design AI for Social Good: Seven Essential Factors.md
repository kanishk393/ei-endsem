The pasted text is a scholarly article titled "How to Design AI for Social Good: Seven Essential Factors" by Luciano Floridi, Josh Cowls, Thomas C. King, and Mariarosaria Taddeo, published online on April 3, 2020. The article addresses the emerging concept of Artificial Intelligence for Social Good (AI4SG), its theoretical underpinnings, practical applications, and the challenges in designing AI that genuinely benefits society. The authors propose a detailed analysis of seven ethical factors essential for AI4SG initiatives, supported by case studies, and offer preliminary guidelines for ensuring AI's positive social impact.

## Abstract and Introduction

The abstract introduces AI4SG as a concept gaining traction within the AI community, aimed at tackling social problems through AI-based solutions. However, there's a noted gap in understanding what constitutes socially good AI both in theory and practice, and how to replicate initial successes. The article aims to fill this gap by identifying seven ethical factors essential for future AI4SG initiatives, supported by 27 case examples.

The introduction further elaborates on the popularity of AI4SG across various sectors, from healthcare to environmental protection, highlighting the diversity and potential of AI applications for social good. Despite the emergence of ethical frameworks for AI, there remains a lack of clarity on what makes AI socially beneficial, leading to potential failures and missed opportunities. The authors argue for a detailed analysis of essential factors to avoid these pitfalls and ensure successful AI4SG projects.

## Methodology

The methodology section outlines the authors' approach to identifying essential factors for AI4SG success. They define AI4SG as AI systems designed to prevent, mitigate, or resolve problems affecting human life and the natural world, or enable socially and environmentally sustainable developments. Through a systematic review of 27 projects, the authors aim to identify clear cases of successful and unsuccessful AI4SG examples. This analysis is grounded in ethical principles of AI, emphasizing beneficence and the need to mitigate foreseeable risks and unintended consequences.

## Seven Essential Factors for AI4SG

The core of the article is the detailed analysis of seven factors deemed essential for the design and deployment of AI4SG:

1. **Falsifiability and Incremental Deployment**: AI4SG projects should be designed to allow for testing and gradual implementation, ensuring they can be adjusted or halted based on outcomes.
2. **Safeguards Against Manipulation of Predictors**: Measures should be in place to prevent the manipulation of AI predictions, ensuring the integrity of AI-based interventions.
3. **Receiver-Contextualised Intervention**: AI interventions should be tailored to the specific contexts of their recipients, considering cultural, social, and individual differences.
4. **Receiver-Contextualised Explanation and Transparent Purposes**: AI4SG initiatives should provide clear, understandable explanations of their operations and goals to their intended beneficiaries.
5. **Privacy Protection and Data Subject Consent**: Projects must safeguard personal privacy and ensure that data is used with the explicit consent of individuals.
6. **Situational Fairness**: AI4SG should strive for fairness, taking into account the diverse situations and backgrounds of those affected by AI interventions.
7. **Human-Friendly Semanticisation**: AI systems should be designed to interact with users in a manner that is understandable and accessible, enhancing the user experience.

Each factor is supported by case studies and leads to corresponding best practices for AI4SG creators. The authors emphasize that these factors are interdependent and should not be viewed as a checklist but as essential considerations for ethical and effective AI design.

## Conclusion

In the concluding section, the authors discuss the importance of balancing the seven factors and addressing potential tensions between them. They stress that the factors identified are necessary but not sufficient conditions for socially good AI. The aim is not to categorize projects as "for social good" in a binary manner but to highlight ethically important characteristics that should inform the design of AI4SG initiatives. The article calls for further research to evaluate these factors, determine who should be responsible for their implementation, and explore supporting mechanisms like regulation or codes of conduct.

This approach helps in managing the unforeseen risks and ensures that the AI systems can be trusted to perform as expected in various contexts.

## 2. Safeguards Against the Manipulation of Predictors

AI systems often rely on predictive models which can be manipulated if the input data or the predictors are known. To counteract this, it is crucial to implement safeguards that prevent the manipulation of data and ensure that non-causal indicators do not skew the outcomes of AI interventions. This involves careful selection and management of the data used by AI systems to maintain their integrity and effectiveness.

## 3. Receiver-Contextualised Intervention

Interventions by AI systems should respect the autonomy of the users and be tailored to their specific contexts and needs. This factor stresses the importance of designing AI interventions that are sensitive to the timing, relevance, and impact on the users, ensuring that they are both effective and minimally intrusive. This approach helps in maintaining user engagement and trust in the AI system.

## 4. Receiver-Contextualised Explanation and Transparent Purposes

AI systems should provide explanations and justifications for their actions that are understandable to the specific users or stakeholders. Transparency about the purposes and functioning of AI interventions is crucial for building trust and accountability.

## 5. Privacy Protection and Data Subject Consent

Protecting the privacy of individuals and ensuring that they consent to the use of their data is fundamental in AI4SG projects. This involves implementing robust data protection measures and ensuring transparency about how data is used, collected, and stored.

## 6. Situational Fairness

AI systems must be designed to be fair in various situations, taking into account the diverse contexts in which they operate. This requires a careful analysis of how AI decisions affect different groups and the implementation of measures to prevent bias and ensure fairness across different scenarios.

## 7. Human-Friendly Semanticisation

The interactions between AI systems and humans should be intuitive and understandable. This involves designing AI outputs and processes in a way that is accessible and easily interpretable by humans, facilitating smoother interactions and better alignment with human values and expectations.

## Conclusion

The text provides a comprehensive framework for designing AI systems that are ethical, effective, and beneficial for social good. By adhering to these seven essential factors, AI4SG projects can achieve greater success and acceptance in society, ensuring that they contribute positively to human and environmental well-being.
